# Factorial Calculator Application

## Overview
This is a console-based Java application that calculates the factorial of a given number using both iterative and recursive methods. It also includes optional data storage using SQLite.

## Features
- Calculate factorial using iterative and recursive methods.
- View calculation history stored in an SQLite database.
- Robust error handling and input validation.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core application logic.
- **SQLite**: Database for storing calculation history.
- **JDBC**: Database interaction.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- SQLite JDBC library (`sqlite-jdbc.jar`).

## Setup and Execution
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Add the SQLite JDBC JAR to your project's build path.
3. Compile and run the application in Eclipse.
4. Export the project as a runnable JAR file.

## Running the Application
1. Execute the JAR file:
   ```bash
   java -jar FactorialApp.jar
